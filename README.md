## Reqirements
The followings were considered as the basic needs that should be satisfied by the solution.<br>
  •	Should be able to control remotely.<br>
  •	Should be compatible with existing home appliances.<br>
  •	Should be able to install easily.<br>
  •	Compatible with industry standards.<br>
  •	Durable and reliable.<br>
  •	should be cost effective.<br><br>
In addition to that following features were intended to be integrated.<br>
  •	Device can be controlled manually as well as remotely through internet and physical buttons.<br>
  •	The device can be connected to any Wi-Fi network without hard coding. Which is a necessity for a consumer IoT device. <br>
  •	Fits into the conventional sunk boxes and can be powered using domestic AC supply.<br>
  •	Can control multiple appliances from one device.<br>
  •	Users can connect the device to a new Wi-Fi network, switch appliances, set timers and monitor using a web interface or mobile app.<br>
  
## Implementation
Considering its in-built WiFi connectivity, impressive processing power and the memory capacity, ESP32 microcontroller is selected as the central control unit of this embedded IoT project. Inbuild capacitive touch sensors of ESP32 were utilized as physical touch buttons. the design files of first prototype can be accessed in [version-01 folder.](version-01/)
